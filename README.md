# Covitrack


## About

Covitrack is a simple COVID-19 tracker built using React-js. It uses an API to detect the active coronavirus cases, number of patients recovered and total deaths worldwide.
A graph is also plotted to depict the coronavirus stats on the basis of the country depicted in the World Map. Density of cases whether active, recovered or deaths are depicted using circular symbols on the map, which is different for countries respectively.


The "red" circle depicts the density of active Coronavirus cases of diiferent countries over the world. The "green" circle shows the total density of recovery in a country, whereas the "dark grey" circle depicts the number of deaths in that country. The list of countries shown in the dropdown menu gives estimate of the total number of cases registered so far.
